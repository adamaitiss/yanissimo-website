## Content & Imagery Guidelines

- Maintain anonymous, yoga-first storytelling: describe scenes with neutral, factual language.
- Do not introduce hotel brand names, bar/alcohol vocabulary, or promotional superlatives in copy, alts, or filenames.
- Prefer serene nature, accommodation, or practice visuals. Remove or replace images that highlight bars, branded signage, or alcohol.
- Run `npm run lint:content` before submitting changes to ensure the blocklist guardrail passes.
- Keep media assets optimized by executing `npm run img:opt` prior to `npm run build`.
